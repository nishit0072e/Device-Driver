# Device-Driver
**Device Driver** is a software program that allows the operating system and applications to communicate with hardware devices, such as printers, keyboards, and hard drives. It acts as a translator between the hardware and the software, enabling the system to control and interact with the device efficiently.

We'll be using a virtual machine platfrom here, so that in any discrepency occur during the work, we won't hurt any system files :)

For code Editing we'll be using ```VsCode``` from host system and a hypervisor platfrom called ```multipass``` will be working in background and VsCode will be connected to it via ssh.

Multipass can be installed in Windows, MacOS & Linux as well.

We'll be showing the steps for Windows and Linux platform.

# Windows platform
